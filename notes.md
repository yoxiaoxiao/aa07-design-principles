# Design Notes - Instagram

Like:
    1. I like the white spaces, which make the images and videos stands out. 
    2. When you hover over the button with your mouse, the surrounding space grays out, highlighting the button.

Dislike:
    1. The font of the name logo in the top left.
    2. The thin boundary line that separates the navigation bar from the posts.
    3. I wish I could customize how many posts are displayed on one page.
